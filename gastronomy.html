                            Well, Deliziosi is launching Deliziosi Gelato Days that starts on December 1st and will run
                            until
                            December 22nd. Deliziosi invites you to bring your family and friends to enjoy our artisanal
                            gelatos in
                            a wide variety of flavours at a special price!!! <br>
                            <hr>

                            <Strong> What is the difference between Gelatos and Ice Cream?</Strong> <br>
                            <br>
                            Gelatos and ice cream are both frozen desserts, but...gelatos contain less fat because they
                            are made
                            with a higher amount of milk than cream, whereas, ice cream is created with only cream.
                            Another
                            difference lies in the process to make either of these desserts. Although both require an
                            ice cream
                            machine to be made, gelatos are churned at slower rate to prevent too much air being whipped
                            into the
                            mix, and thus, making it denser. Unlike ice cream, gelatos must be served at a higher
                            temperature
                            because otherwise it would be too hard to scoop!

                            <br>
                            By using only, the best locally-sourced, freshest, and hand-selected ingredients, our team
                            of experts
                            will prepare the three most common types of gelatos that are found in many shops in Italy:
                            gelato,
                            sorbetto, and granita. Not sure which type to try?
                            Here is a brief overview of each:
                            <br><hr>
                            <strong>Gelato</strong><br>
                            <br>
                            Base: milk, sugar, air, flavour
                            Process: churned in ice cream machine, stored at high temperature
                            Texture: soft
                            <br><hr>

                            <br>
                            Base: sugar, water, flavour (fruit puree, fruit juice, wine, coffee, and many other options

                            Process: churned in ice cream machine
                            Texture: smooth, icier than gelato

                            <br><hr>
                            <strong>Granita </strong><br>
                            <br>
                            Base: sugar, water, flavour (fruit puree, fruit juice, wine, coffee, and many other options

                            Process: frozen on a thin sheet, scraped instead of scooped,
                            Texture: coarser than the other types
                            Enjoy it with whipped cream on top!
